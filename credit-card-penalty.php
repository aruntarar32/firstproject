                <h4 class="blog_pg_hd">Always pay your bill on time</h4>
               

                <p>There are substantial interest charges and extra amounts on any bank credit card on your overdue payments, which are high compared to other pieces. Paying only 5 percent of the outstanding credit card amount is compulsory. It can roll over the balance to the next month with a long bill. But you should completely ignore doing as this is the fastest way to land in that debt trap. If you do not even make the less amount of 5 percent charges by the due date, a late bill payment fee and interest charges and taxes are chargeable.</p>

                <p>Do not roll over the outstanding balance to the next billing cycle. It will obtain a monthly interest rate of more than 3-4 percent, and if you keep rolling over and over without making a new purchase each month, the interest rate portion may soon take you into a giant debt trap. Generally, an interest rate-free cycle on a credit card bill purchase will go up to more than 45 days of your credit card bill. The payment plan is in place before you take on more considerable expenses and make consistent on-time payments.</p>

                <h4 class="blog_pg_hd">Convert your card payment into an easy EMI</h4>
